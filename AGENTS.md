### Guidelines

* Do not implement fallbacks; the principle is fail early, fail hard!
* Take a step back and refactor at every golden opportunity
* Chunk larger jobs/updates into smaller edits, in such a way that the code is kept working in between each edit - aim at at least once per minute (main reason: the connection might have a hiccup and all progress gets lost)
